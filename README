This is a small project regarding weather forecast using Precipitation, Temperature, Streamflow to forecast x-day ahead the streamflow.
The project utilize Recurrent Neural Network Long Short Term Memory framework running on Clemson's Palmetto HPC platform.
The project at the time being only use station data. However, I am working on improving it using gridded data and ability to predict for all days up to x-day ahead of time.
